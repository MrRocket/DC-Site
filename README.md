# Simple Website Using Github Pages


This is a fork of: [cplmakerlab/simple-website-template](https://github.com/cplmakerlab/simple-website-template)

That I used as well, a template.. then quickly realized..
Heck, I can just upload the site I was working on locally here!

So, here it is! ;) 

# The Web site is for Doom Connector
 
 Which is now redirected to this domain: 
 [doomconnector.com](https://www.doomconnector.com/)
